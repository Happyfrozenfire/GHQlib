1. Do whatever you like with the original work, just don't be a dick.

   Being a dick includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:

 1a. Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy this and change the name.
 1b. Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that's REALLY being a dick.
 1c. Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That would make you a PROPER dick.
 1d. Using the Software with the intent of causing physical, emotional, mental, or other harm to 
     another sentient being, including but not limited to humans, sufficiently complex aliens, 
	 sufficiently complex animals, sufficiently complex AI, etc. That would make you a dick this 
	 license is specifically future-proofed against.
 1e. Using the Software with the intent of mocking a socially acceptable target marginalized group, 
     including but not limited to children, autists, other neurodivergents, athiests, men, women, 
	 members of the LGBT community, etc. That would make you a LeafyIsHere level dick, as well as
	 making me obligated to hate you for making the world a worse place as a whole.
 1f. Using the Software with the intent of mocking a socially unacceptable target marginalized group
     including but not limited to people of color, Cental Americans, South Americans, Africans, East
	 Europeans, Middle Eastians, Asians, etc. That would make you a Keemstar/Trump shrivelled-up 
	 golden shower Toad dick.
 1g. Using the Software to knowingly spread misinformation makes you a giant balls, pencil shaft dick.

2. If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work,
share the love. Only a dick would make loads off this work and not buy the original work's
creator(s) a pint.

3. Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and bitching when it goes wrong makes
you a DONKEY dick. Fix the problem yourself. A non-dick would submit the fix back.

4. Crockford Addendum: The Software shall be used for Good, not Evil. All instances of Evil are also
instances of dickery, which make you a dick.
